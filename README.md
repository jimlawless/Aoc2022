My stats so far:

    These are your personal leaderboard statistics. Rank is your position on 
    that leaderboard: 1 means you were the first person to get that star, 2 
    means the second, 100 means the 100th, etc. Score is the number of points 
    you got for that rank: 100 for 1st, 99 for 2nd, ..., 1 for 100th, and 0 
    otherwise.
