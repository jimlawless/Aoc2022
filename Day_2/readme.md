I rushed through the first challenge and I botched the initial attempt at solving it.  After fixing the approach, the second challenge was easier to complete.

After a good night's sleep, it occurred to me that each problem could have been solved with a lookup table that paired the opponent's input character with mine as a key. 

My initial commit shows the brute force approach.  The newest commit for each file uses the table lookup approach.
